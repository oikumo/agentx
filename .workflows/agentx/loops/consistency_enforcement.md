The agentx application implementation must be consistent and follow the requirements and the feature expectations. 
The error must be fixed and Python and OMT++ intend must be followed

# Rules
1. Do not follow the omt methodology, focus on the applications as a whole
2. Use omt think everywhere omt feature to put knowledge in the source code itself
3. Create automated unit test whenever is possible to verify if part of the implementation is wrong, use mocks
4. Try to use sub agents for parallel analysis whenever is possible and useful

# Applying consistency strategy
1. Read the project documentation and requirements
2. Understand the current application implementation and try to find gaps between the core idea the actual implementation
3. Identify the issues if they exist, and propose fix alternatives in a new document or update one document in ./sandbox/consistency_enforcement/round_<NNN>_<BRIEF_DESCRIPTION>.md
4. Ask the user what alternatives have to perform the changes to improve the agentx consistency
5. Execute the alternative chosen by the user
6. Update the results in the same file of step 3, ./sandbox/consistency_enforcement/round_<NNN>_<BRIEF_DESCRIPTION>.md
