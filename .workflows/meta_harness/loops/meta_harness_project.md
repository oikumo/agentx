The META HARNESS must help to the human user to mechanize to the coding agent opencode software development  
following a clear path, guided by rules and constraint that allow to improve the process performance during the development 
tasks execution. Must evolve, gathering knowledge and improving the META HARNESS and the source code itself.

The META HARNESS current state has features and characteristics that force the coding agent to follow a methodology
to develop software, but always can be improved, so the improvements must be found by you. The improvement strategy is bellow.

# Project development rules
1. Consider previous project iterations history
2. Focus in future coding agent token consumption minimization usage 
3. The main goal is to improve the coding agent performance, not human-readable artifacts
4. Focus on project idea, the main feature 
5. Any possible refactor opportunities must be considered when it is found 
6. Focus on META HARNESS flexibility for future changes 
7. Try to use sub agents for parallel analysis whenever is possible and useful

# Project strategy
1. Understand deeply what is META HARNESS using the META HARNESS artifacts available **DO NOT SEARCH THE SOURCE CODE**
2. Understand the current structure and behavior of META HARNESS in the whole workspace **USING META HARNESS TOOLBOX**
3. Create the project home mechanically: `uv run scripts/omt/project.py new "<name>"` — creates `.projects/meta/<slug>/{PROJECT.md,CURRENT_STATE.md}` from templates + the ledger lifecycle record + the GENERATED manifest row (feature_030). Iterate PROJECT.md freely (non-gated); spawn features with `new_feature.py "<name>" --project <slug>`; close with `project.py close <slug>`.
4. Propose to the user the project idea with alternatives
5. Refine the project idea 
6. Propose to the user a plan to implement the project for him approval 
7. Execute the project
