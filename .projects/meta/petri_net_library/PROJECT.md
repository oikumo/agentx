# PROJECT: petri_net_library — Weighted P/T Petri-net library for agentx

> Status: **complete** · v1 SHIPPED 2026-08-23 (feature_031.petri_net_library Done) · v1.1 (2026-08-22), iter 9 (2026-08-23) — project home created from the requirement anchor `.meta/doc/petri_nets/petri_net_python_coding_agents.md`. Scope LOCKED by user approval ("execute the project", 2026-08-22); v1 implemented, tested, and landed (suite 1577 passed, 0 regressions).

---

## New Session Quick Start

> One line: pure-Python weighted P/T Petri-net library (execution + analysis layers, exact rational invariants, completeness-explicit results) — **v1 SHIPPED 2026-08-23** in `src/agentx/model/petri_net/` (99 tests); v2 backlog = coverability (Karp–Miller), siphons/traps, home markings, simulator, DOT/JSON export, optimization.

**Next:** nothing v1 — consume the library (`agentx.model.petri_net.model` / `.analysis` / `.errors`) or scope v2 / feature_001 (the future consumer, D11) as separate work. Test report @ `6.testing/features/feature_031.petri_net_library/test_report.md`.

---

## Summary (one line)

**A pure-Python, zero-dependency weighted Place/Transition Petri-net library for agentx** — two clearly separated layers: an **execution/model layer** (places, transitions, weighted arcs, markings, enabledness, atomic firing) and an **analysis layer** (BFS reachability, reachability graph, firing sequences, deadlocks, bounds, incidence matrix, P/T-invariants via exact rational arithmetic, transition liveness on complete finite graphs, SCC) — with explicit, completeness-aware semantics (`complete=True/False`, `max_states` limit only in v1, no overclaiming). Coverability, simulation, and advanced structural analyses are v2.

---

## Purpose

### What this project is

A new, standalone library in `src/agentx/model/petri_net/` (layout adapted to the agentx `src/agentx/model/<pkg>/` convention: `model.py`, `analysis.py`, `coverability.py`, `errors.py`, `__init__.py`, plus tests under `tests/model/petri_net/`). The library implements:

- **Model layer** — weighted P/T net `N = (P, T, F, W, M0)`; places hold integer token counts, transitions fire atomically when all input requirements are met, arcs carry positive integer weights; core API per doc §9/§10 (`add_place`, `add_transition`, `add_input`, `add_output`, `is_enabled_at`, `fire`, `fire_marking` (pure), `enabled_transitions_at`, `current_marking`, `reset`).
- **Analysis layer** — `PetriNetAnalyzer` operating on the model without mutating its live marking and without UI/database/visualization coupling: `reachable_markings`, `reachability_graph`, `firing_sequence_to`, `deadlocks`, `bounds`, `incidence_matrix`, `place_invariants`, `transition_invariants`, `transition_liveness`, `is_live`, `strongly_connected_components`. Coverability is a v2 stub (`NotImplementedError`).
- **Completeness semantics** — result objects expose `value: bool | None`, `complete: bool`, `explored_states`, `reason`; every exploration API takes `max_states` only in v1 (no `max_depth`/`time_limit`) and never claims proof from a truncated search (§27–28, §39).
- **Determinism** — canonical immutable tuple markings over a stable `place_order`; sorted iteration everywhere; no dependence on `set` order (§6.2, §29).
- **Exact arithmetic** — P/T invariants computed via pure-Python rational Gaussian elimination (zero dependencies; doc §18 "~40 lines sufficient for v1").

### What this project is **not**

- **Not feature_001.** `feature_001.session_user_objectives_driven_by_Petri_Net` (internal state module `src/agentx/model/internal_state`, `USER_OBJECTIVES.md` CRC-driven structure) is a *future consumer* of this library — the library is the generic foundation, feature_001 is the application wiring. Neither is implemented here; this project home defines only the library.
- **Not a UI/TUI/console feature.** Pure model+analysis library; no screens, no controllers, no deepagents/coding-agent integration.
- **Not a simulation engine.** `simulator.py` (one-path policies, doc §26) is **v2** — not part of v1 scope. The analysis layer is a reasoning layer, not a simulation layer.
- **Not an optimization project.** Correctness and explicit semantics first; doc §33 basics (tuples, precomputed indexes, deque, sorted order) only. Matrix/sparse/symbolic/partial-order methods are later work.
- **Not a graphviz/JSON reporting project.** DOT export and JSON reports are advanced optional tools (§36), out of the first iteration.
- **Not a coverability implementation.** `coverability.py` exports a stub raising `NotImplementedError`; Karp–Miller is v2 (doc §17).
- **No `graph.py` module in v1.** SCC (Tarjan) lives in `analysis.py`; separate `graph.py` is premature modularization.

### Requirement anchor (the starting point)

The full requirement is `.meta/doc/petri_nets/petri_net_python_coding_agents.md` (41 sections). **v1 scope extracts only §1–16, §18–21, §23–24, §27–35, §36 (v1 checklist items only), §40 items 1–17, 19** (model layer, BFS analyses, exact invariants, liveness on finite graphs, SCC, completeness semantics, module structure, test patterns, architecture rules, minimum toolkit). v2 sections (§17 coverability, §22 home markings, §25 siphons/traps, §26 simulation, §36 advanced items — DOT/JSON export, §37 example) are explicitly excluded from v1. §41 (final mental model) is a guiding principle quoted below, not a scoped section.

Non-negotiable requirements this project inherits:

1. Two-layer separation (execution vs analysis) — §Purpose, §34.
2. Weighted P/T semantics: `M'(p) = M(p) − W(p,t) + W(t,p)`; enabledness is AND over inputs; firing is atomic; disabled firing raises `TransitionNotEnabledError`; pure `fire_marking` + mutable `fire` (§4–5).
3. Canonical ordering (`place_order`/`place_index`) and deterministic iteration (§6.2, §29).
4. Edge-case coverage: self-loops, no-input (always enabled), no-output transitions, parallel transitions (distinct labels), zero-token places, **empty net allowed** (consistent analysis), duplicate-arc policy: reject (§8, §38).
5. Exact integer/rational arithmetic for incidence matrix and invariants (§18–19) — **pure-Python rational Gaussian elimination** (zero dependencies; D4 decision).
6. Completeness-explicit results and analysis limits (§27–28, §39): `True` = proven, `False` = disproven, `None` = unknown/incomplete.
7. Coverability (Karp–Miller) as a separate v2 module; truncated BFS is never labeled "unbounded" (§17).
8. Definition of Done = doc §40 items 1–17, 19; minimum analysis toolkit = doc §36 checklist (v1 items only).

### Recurring principles (invariants the library preserves)

- **Model defines possible state changes; marking is the state; firing changes the state; analysis systematically explores or mathematically reasons about those state changes** (doc §41).
- **No overclaiming** — proven true / proven false / unknown are distinct, never conflated (§39).
- **Analysis never mutates the live marking** — pure transformations over immutable markings (§5.4, §34).
- **Deterministic tests** — sorted places/transitions, reproducible reports (§29, §34).
- **TDD** — when this project becomes a feature, it is `task_type:"major_feature"`; feature_016 TDD auto-activates at Programming (red → green → refactor at the same test_node).
- **Zero dependencies** — pure Python standard library only; exact rational arithmetic implemented inline.

---

## Vision + standing principle + main objectives

**Standing principle (non-negotiable): the analysis layer is a reasoning layer, not a simulation layer.** The model layer executes one firing at a time; the analysis layer explores *all* relevant possibilities (BFS over markings, exact algebra for invariants) and reports *exactly* what it proved, what it disproved, and what remains unknown — never a bare `False` for "search stopped early."

**Main objectives — the project is justified by three outcomes:**

- **(a) A correct, semantics-explicit P/T Petri-net engine.** Places/transitions/weighted arcs/enabledness/firing per the doc's formal model; all edge cases (§38) behave per formal semantics; errors are typed (`PetriNetError` hierarchy: `InvalidModelError`, `UnknownPlaceError`, `UnknownTransitionError`, `TransitionNotEnabledError`). Verified by doc §40 DoD items 1–6 tests.
- **(b) A trustworthy analysis toolkit (v1).** Reachability, reachability graph, shortest firing sequence, deadlocks, bounds, incidence matrix, P/T-invariants (pure-Python exact rational arithmetic), transition liveness on complete finite graphs, SCC — each returning completeness-explicit results with `max_states` limit. Verified by DoD items 7–17, 19 tests, including "unknown" cases (§30, §40-19).
- **(c) The foundation feature_001 consumes.** When `feature_001.session_user_objectives_driven_by_Petri_Net` is scoped, the library is the ready, tested substrate for the internal-state Petri net — no re-implementation needed. (The feature_001 wiring itself is NOT this project's scope.)

**What is NOT the vision:** not a UI feature; not a research-grade state-space optimizer; not a graphviz/reporting tool; not a simulation engine; not a coverability implementation (v2).

## Scope & success criteria (LOCKED v1.1 — approved 2026-08-22)

> Locked v1.1. The requirement doc is the anchor; the boundary below is the approved scope. Changes require an explicit re-lock decision recorded in the iteration log.

### In scope (draft v1)

1. **Model layer** — `PetriNet` with the doc §9 API (streamlined): `add_place`, `add_transition`, `add_input`, `add_output`, `is_enabled_at`, `fire`, `fire_marking` (pure), `enabled_transitions_at`, `current_marking`, `reset`, canonical tuple markings (`place_order`/`place_index`), structural queries (`pre_set`/`post_set`, §24). Convenience wrappers `is_enabled()` and `enabled_transitions()` omitted (call `_at` variants directly). Typed error hierarchy in `errors.py`: `PetriNetError` (base) with `InvalidModelError` (incl. duplicate-arc rejection), `UnknownPlaceError`, `UnknownTransitionError`, `TransitionNotEnabledError`. — `reset()` restores the **initial marking `M0`**; `fire_marking(M, t)` is **pure** and **raises `TransitionNotEnabledError` when `t` is not enabled at `M`** (the caller may guard with `is_enabled_at`); mutable `fire(t)` applies the same check against the live marking.
2. **Analysis layer (v1 minimum toolkit, doc §36 filtered)** — `reachable_markings` (BFS, predecessor map), `reachability_graph`, `firing_sequence_to` (returns the firing sequence **or `None`** when the target is unreachable within `max_states`, with `complete`/`reason` set on truncation), `deadlocks`, `bounds`, `incidence_matrix` (exact), `place_invariants`, `transition_invariants` (pure-Python exact rational Gaussian elimination), `transition_liveness`/`is_live` (operate on a **precomputed `reachability_graph`** — per §32 they take the graph explicitly — returning `AnalysisResult`; definitive verdict only via reverse-BFS on a finite *complete* graph, `value=None` when the supplied graph is incomplete, never a bare `bool`), `strongly_connected_components` (Tarjan, computed on the **reachability graph**). `coverability_tree` is a stub raising `NotImplementedError`.
3. **Completeness semantics + limits** — result dataclasses with `complete`/`reason`; **`max_states` only** on every exploration API (no `max_depth`/`time_limit` in v1); no hidden hard-coded limits.
4. **Edge cases** — self-loops, no-input/no-output transitions, parallel transitions, zero-token places, empty net allowed (consistent analysis: `()` marking, no enabled transitions, bounded=True, empty invariants), duplicate arcs: reject.
5. **Tests** — `tests/model/petri_net/` (`test_model.py`, `test_analysis.py`, `test_coverability.py`): model, analysis, coverability stub; both positive results AND "unknown" cases (doc §30, §40-19). The existing `test_petri_net.py` placeholder stub is **deleted** when these are added.

   **Per-function test-coverage matrix (every analysis fn gets a happy test + a truncated/"unknown" test — directly operationalizes §40-19 and the "no overclaim" rule):**

   | Function | Happy test | "Unknown" / truncated test (`complete=False`, `reason` set) |
   |----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `reachable_markings` | finite net, known marking set | `max_states` hit before full exploration |
   | `reachability_graph` | finite net, known graph | `max_states` hit → `complete=False` |
   | `firing_sequence_to` | reachable target → sequence | unreachable within `max_states` → `None`, `complete=False` |
   | `deadlocks` | net with known deadlock | truncated search ⇒ `complete=False` (never "deadlock-free") |
   | `bounds` | complete finite graph, known bounds | `max_states` hit ⇒ `complete=False` (never `bounded=True`) |
   | `incidence_matrix` | known net | structural (no truncation); full-space tests for degenerate nets |
   | `place_invariants` / `transition_invariants` | known invariants | degenerate nets (places-no-transitions / transitions-no-places) full-space basis |
   | `transition_liveness` / `is_live` | complete finite graph → verdict | **incomplete** graph supplied → `value=None`, `complete=False` |
   | `strongly_connected_components` | known SCCs on reachability graph | (computed on graph; `complete` inherited from graph) |
   | `coverability_tree` (stub) | raises `NotImplementedError` | — |

### Out of scope (explicit non-goals, draft v1)

- **No feature_001 work** — no `src/agentx/model/internal_state/`, no `USER_OBJECTIVES.md`/CRC wiring.
- **No UI/TUI/console/deepagents integration.**
- **No `simulator.py`** — v2 (doc §26: simulation is not analysis).
- **No `graph.py`** — SCC in `analysis.py` for v1; separate module only if needed later.
- **No coverability implementation** — `coverability.py` stub only; Karp–Miller is v2 (doc §17).
- **No siphons/traps** (§25 — advanced optional).
- **No home-marking analysis** (§22 — advanced optional).
- **No Graphviz/DOT export or JSON analysis reports** (advanced optional, §36).
- **No state-space optimization** (sparse matrices, partial-order/symmetry/symbolic reduction — §33 "later optimizations").
- **No `max_depth`/`time_limit` parameters** — v1 uses `max_states` only.

### Success criteria (draft — mapped to requirement doc)

- Doc §40 DoD items 1–17, 19 all demonstrably pass (execution items 1–6; analysis items 7–17, 19). **Excluded: §40-18 (Coverability analysis for unbounded nets) is v2 / Karp–Miller — already out of scope via D5 + the `coverability.py` stub, so it is not part of v1 sign-off.**
- Doc §36 minimum analysis toolkit checklist complete (v1 items only).
- Every truncated/limited exploration returns `complete=False` with a reason — tests assert this, not just the happy path (§30).
- Full suite green; when implemented as a feature: TDD closed via `omt_tdd{op:done}` with `checklist.suite_passes:true`, NOT via `omt_skip`.
- Zero external dependencies (`pyproject.toml` unchanged for this library).

### Boundaries (draft, one line each)

- **What changes (will change):** new `src/agentx/model/petri_net/` package (`model.py`, `analysis.py`, `coverability.py`, `errors.py`, `__init__.py`) + real tests under `tests/model/petri_net/` (`test_model.py`, `test_analysis.py`, `test_coverability.py`) replacing — and deleting — the placeholder `test_petri_net.py` stub; `pyproject.toml` **unchanged** (zero dependencies).
- **What does not change:** `src/agentx/model/internal_state/` (does not exist yet — feature_001's future home, untouched by design), the harness, the enforcer, all existing agentx modules.
- **What is deferred (future, not this project):** feature_001 integration, coverability implementation, siphons/traps, home markings, DOT/JSON export, state-space optimization, `simulator.py`, `graph.py`, `max_depth`/`time_limit` parameters.

## Lock sign-off checklist (review iter 6 — pending user)

> Collected from the 2026-08-22 review so approval is a single action. Each item is either already satisfied or a one-line decision.

- [x] **Approve v1/v2 section split** (§1–16, §18–21, §23–24, §27–35, §36 v1-checklist-items-only, §40 items 1–17, 19 in scope; §17/§22/§25/§26/§36-advanced/§37 v2; §41 = principle, not scoped). *(approved 2026-08-22)*
- [x] **Name excluded DoD item** — §40-18 (Coverability for unbounded nets) is v2; already reflected in D5 + `coverability.py` stub. *(satisfied — see Success criteria)*
- [x] **Approve edge-case policy D7** (self-loops, no-input/no-output, parallel, zero-token, empty net, degenerate-net invariant basis, duplicate-arc rejection). *(approved 2026-08-22)*
- [x] **Approve feature slug policy (D1):** suffix `.petri_net_library`, number auto-assigned by `new_feature.py` at scaffold (next free slot verified 2026-08-22: **031** — 030 is taken by `feature_030.project_lifecycle`). *(approved 2026-08-22)*
- [x] **Confirm `max_states` is a required parameter with no implicit default (D9 addendum).** *(satisfied)*
- [x] **Confirm `fire_marking(M,t)` raises `TransitionNotEnabledError` when disabled; `reset()` restores `M0` (model-API addendum).** *(satisfied)*
- [x] **Confirm `PetriNetAnalyzer` binding** (constructor `PetriNetAnalyzer(net)` vs per-call `net`) — **RESOLVED iter 8:** constructor binding `PetriNetAnalyzer(net)`; pinned in design doc.
- [x] **Confirm feature_001 runtime-mutation needs** (add-only vs add+remove) — **RESOLVED iter 8:** add-only is sufficient; FEATURE.md requires structure updates on CRC change, satisfiable by rebuilding a fresh `PetriNet` from the updated `USER_OBJECTIVES.md` (replacement, not in-place removal). In-place removal is a non-breaking v2 addition if ever needed.
- [x] **Adopt the per-function test-coverage matrix** (happy + "unknown" case for every analysis fn) — see In-scope #5. *(satisfied)*

On all boxes ticked: flip `Scope & success criteria` Status to **locked** (v1.1) and proceed to scaffold the feature via the command in Status (number auto-assigned by `new_feature.py`, see D1).

## Design-phase must-pin checklist (owned by the scaffolded feature's design doc)

> These are deliberately NOT resolved in the project home; they are recorded here so the design phase cannot skip them.

1. **`AnalysisResult` exact fields** — `(value: bool | None, complete: bool, explored_states: int, reason: str | None)`; payload-carrying analyses use their own dataclasses sharing the `complete`/`reason` contract (D5).
2. **`PetriNetAnalyzer` binding** — constructor vs per-call `net` (review item above).
3. **`fire_marking` disabled behavior** — raise `TransitionNotEnabledError` (model-API addendum).
4. **`reset()` target** — restore `M0` (model-API addendum).
5. **`max_states` default policy** — required, no implicit default (D9 addendum).
6. **Per-function test matrix** — happy + truncated/"unknown" test node for each analysis fn (Success criteria + In-scope #5).
7. **`__init__.py` exports** — **RESOLVED (iter 7):** docstring-only, no re-exports, matching the verified `src/agentx/model/` convention (e.g. `rag_v2/__init__.py` is docstring-only); callers import from `agentx.model.petri_net.model` / `.analysis`. Nothing left to pin.

---

## Out-of-scope reminders (deferred, not done by this document)

- Feature dir scaffolding — `.meta/software_development_process/{2.requirements,...}/features/feature_NNN.petri_net_library/` is **not** created by this document (user: "project, no feature yet"); NNN is auto-assigned by `new_feature.py` at scaffold time (see D1).
- Phase declaration — no `omt_phase` is invoked by this document.
- `src/` edits — none; this document is project-home markdown only.
- Any design/analysis/test artifacts — owned by the future feature phases, not by this project home.

---

## Decisions log (draft — confirm or revise on approval)

- **D1 — Project slug is `petri_net_library`; feature slug suffix `.petri_net_library`, number auto-assigned by `new_feature.py` at scaffold time** (it computes max existing + 1 — never hard-code the number in docs). Next free slot verified 2026-08-22: **031** (`feature_030.project_lifecycle` took 030; the iter-0 assumption "next free 030" is stale). Confirmed NOT scaffolded yet.
- **D2 — Library location `src/agentx/model/petri_net/`** (agentx model-layer convention, e.g. `session/`, `rag_v2/`), module layout: `model.py`, `analysis.py`, `coverability.py`, `errors.py`, `__init__.py` (docstring-only, no re-exports — matches the verified `src/agentx/model/` convention, e.g. `rag_v2/__init__.py` is docstring-only; callers import from `agentx.model.petri_net.model` / `.analysis`). **No `graph.py`, no `simulator.py` in v1.**
- **D3 — Two-layer separation is mandatory** — execution/model layer and analysis layer; analysis never mutates the live marking; `fire_marking` is pure (§5.4, §34).
- **D4 — Exact arithmetic for invariants: pure-Python rational Gaussian elimination (LOCKED).** Doc §18 recommends `sympy` but also states *"a small exact-rational Gaussian-elimination nullspace (~40 lines) is sufficient for v1"*. **Decision: zero dependencies, implement inline.** No `sympy` added to `pyproject.toml`.
- **D5 — Completeness-explicit results everywhere** (§27, §39): `AnalysisResult(value: bool | None, complete: bool, explored_states: int, reason: str | None)`; `transition_liveness`/`is_live` return `AnalysisResult` with `value=None` when the supplied reachability graph is incomplete (never a bare `bool`; `is_home_marking` is v2 — home-marking analysis is out of v1 scope); payload-carrying analyses (`reachability`, `graph`, `deadlocks`, `bounds`) use their own dataclasses with the same `complete`/`reason` contract. **`bounds` no-overclaim rule:** observing finite per-place token counts in the *explored* portion must return `complete=False` when `max_states` is hit — never `bounded=True` from a truncated search (same §39 rule as never labeling a truncated BFS "unbounded" or "deadlock-free").
- **D6 — Deterministic ordering** — `place_order`/`transition_order` sorted; markings are tuples; no `set`-iteration dependence anywhere (§6.2, §29). Concretely `place_order = tuple(sorted(self._places))` and `transition_order = tuple(sorted(self._transitions))`, so canonical tuple markings are stable across runs and sessions (rule pinned here, realized in design phase).
- **D7 — Edge-case policy** — self-loops legal; no-input transitions always enabled; no-output transitions legal (consume-and-vanish); parallel transitions distinct by name; zero tokens meaningful; **empty net** (zero places **and** zero transitions) allowed with consistent analysis (`()` initial marking, no enabled transitions, `bounded=True`, empty invariants, incidence matrix 0×0); **degenerate-but-nonempty nets also allowed** — (a) places-but-no-transitions: incidence P×0, place-invariants = full-space basis (each place individually), `bounds`/`deadlocks` consistent, no enabled transitions; (b) transitions-but-no-places: incidence 0×T, transition-invariants = full-space basis, no-input transitions always enabled; duplicate arcs: reject (doc §38 "simplest API should reject duplicates") — re-adding an existing (place, transition) input/output arc raises `InvalidModelError` regardless of weight; changing an arc weight requires removing then re-adding.
- **D8 — API simplification: no convenience wrappers** — `is_enabled(transition)` and `enabled_transitions()` removed from v1; callers use `is_enabled_at(current_marking(), transition)` and `enabled_transitions_at(current_marking())` directly. Pure `fire_marking` + mutable `fire` retained.
- **D9 — v1 limits: `max_states` only** — no `max_depth`/`time_limit` parameters in v1 signatures; add in v2 when needed. **`max_states` is a required parameter with no implicit default** on every exploration API, so there is never a hidden limit (In-scope #3, 'no hidden hard-coded limits').
- **D10 — TDD is mandatory when implemented** — `major_feature` → feature_016 auto-activates at Programming; close via `omt_tdd{op:done}`, not `omt_skip`.
- **D11 — feature_001 relationship: consumer, not scope** — this library is the generic substrate; `feature_001.session_user_objectives_driven_by_Petri_Net` (internal state, USER_OBJECTIVES.md) is a separate future feature that consumes it. **Integration note (confirm before lock):** feature_001's FEATURE.md describes an *adaptive* net with CRC-driven runtime restructuring; confirm whether it needs **runtime removal** of places/arcs (the v1 model API is add-only mutation). The lib must not be locked into a shape its only known consumer cannot use.

## Iteration log

- **iter 9 (2026-08-23)** — **v1 SHIPPED** via `feature_031.petri_net_library` (full phase pipeline: Analysis → Design → TDD Programming → Testing → Done). Implementation: 3 TDD cycles (26-behavior testlist; red→green→refactor at same file-level node; genuine exit-1 REDs via deferred imports — a top-level import of the cycle's missing module aborts collection at pytest exit 2, which `cmd_start` rejects). `src/agentx/model/petri_net/{errors,model,analysis,coverability,__init__}.py` + `tests/model/petri_net/{test_model,test_analysis,test_coverability}.py` (June placeholder deleted); sentinel + conftest bridge at `tests/features/feature_031.petri_net_library/` for the omt_complete pattern. `omt_tdd{op:done}` checklist all green; 99 canonical tests; full suite 1577 passed, 0 regressions vs baseline. Build decisions: placeholder deletion at bootstrap (two-hats blocks tests/ at green); SCC restricted to graph vertex set; empty-net `is_live` = `(True,True,1)` (F1). DoD §40 items 1–17, 19 verified (item 18 = v2 stub per D5). Project status → **v1 SHIPPED**; v2 backlog (coverability Karp–Miller, siphons/traps, home markings, simulator, DOT/JSON, optimization) + feature_001 consumption remain separate work.
- **iter 8 (2026-08-22)** — **scope LOCKED v1.1** by user approval ("execute the project"). All lock sign-off boxes ticked: v1/v2 section split, D7 edge-case policy, D1 slug policy approved as drafted; `PetriNetAnalyzer` binding resolved to **constructor binding** `PetriNetAnalyzer(net)` (design doc pins it); D11 feature_001 runtime-mutation need resolved — **add-only is sufficient** (CRC-change restructuring = rebuild a fresh `PetriNet` from updated `USER_OBJECTIVES.md`; in-place removal is a non-breaking v2 addition if ever needed). Header flipped to locked v1.1; proceeding to scaffold the feature (`new_feature.py`, number auto-assigned per D1) and run the phase pipeline (Analysis → Design → TDD Programming → Testing). No src/ changes yet.
- **iter 1 (2026-08-16)** — project home `.projects/meta/petri_net_library/` created per user request ("create a new project for a petri net library for agentx, follow this doc as a requirement starting point"; "do not implement anything, just create the project"; "project, no feature yet"). PROJECT.md v1 shipped: Summary, Purpose (what/not/requirement anchor/principles), Vision + standing principle + objectives (draft), Scope & success criteria (draft — explicitly NOT locked, awaiting user approval), Status checklist (feature dir + phase marked pending by user instruction), Decisions log D1–D9 (draft), Iteration log, References. Companion `CURRENT_STATE.md` iter-0 created. Facts verified before writing: next free feature slot is 030 *(true at iter-0; stale since 2026-08-22 — `feature_030.project_lifecycle` took it; see D1)*; `tests/model/petri_net/test_petri_net.py` exists as a June placeholder stub (library tests will replace it); `src/agentx/model/petri_net/` does not exist; `pyproject.toml` has `numpy`, no `sympy` (drives D4); `src/agentx/model/` uses flat packages with empty `__init__.py` (drives D2).
- **iter 2 (2026-08-16)** — scope refinement for feasibility & simplicity per user review: (1) extracted v1-only scope from 41-section doc, (2) locked D4 to pure-Python rational nullspace (zero deps), (3) removed `simulator.py` and `graph.py` from v1, (4) coverability.py is stub only, (5) `max_states` only limit in v1, (6) removed convenience wrappers `is_enabled()`/`enabled_transitions()`, (7) explicit empty-net policy, (8) test matrix for "unknown" cases, (9) updated module list, decisions D1–D11, boundaries, success criteria.
- **iter 3 (2026-08-16)** — requirement-doc feasibility/simplicity review per user request ("review the project @.meta/doc/petri_nets/ … improve the project itself, do not implement anything more"). Edited the anchor doc (no src/, no feature): (1) §30 example nets now carry explicit arcs and `make_net()` builds them (previously unbuildable — arcs existed only in prose); (2) §18/§19 replaced the sympy-only invariant code with the zero-dependency exact-rational `nullspace()` + `_coprime_int_vector()` reference implementation, making D4 fully specified; (3) §20–§22 liveness/home-marking now return `AnalysisResult` (the doc's own §27 rule was violated by bare `bool | None`); (4) §32 API pinned — analyzer liveness methods take the graph explicitly; (5) §28 pins `max_states` semantics for truncated results; (6) empty-net policy decided in-doc (§38, matches D7); (7) v1/v2 section map table added; (8) duplicated admonition removed; (9) module layouts (§11/§35) aligned to v1 (no simulator/graph.py; coverability stub); (10) convenience wrappers marked optional (§9), Place/Transition dataclasses explicitly optional in v1 (§3/§4). PROJECT.md updated: D5 clarified, in-scope item 2 wording, this log entry.
- **iter 4 (2026-08-16)** — second feasibility/simplicity review of the anchor doc: fixed critical correctness bug in `nullspace()` (zero-row matrices undercounted columns, breaking invariants for places-but-no-transitions and transitions-but-no-places) by adding `n_cols` parameter; added sign normalization to `_coprime_int_vector` for deterministic test results; added missing non-negativity validation to `marking_to_dict` per §6.3 spec; cleaned up module trees in §11/§35 (removed v2 files from v1 tree, fixed `test_graph.py` inconsistency); removed confusing §8.5 ASCII diagram; added `add_input`/`add_output` argument-order gotcha note in §9; added §31 duplication note; extended §38 with explicit edge-case docs for degenerate nets. No src/ changes — doc-only improvements.
- **iter 5 (2026-08-22)** — review-driven doc fixes to the project home (no src/, no feature; user approved "do the doc fixes"). Resolved review findings: **N** removed `is_home_marking` from D5 (home-marking is v2, out of scope); **A** pinned liveness methods take the reachability graph explicitly (§32) and return `value=None` on incomplete graphs; **C** expanded D7 with degenerate-but-nonempty nets (places-no-transitions, transitions-no-places) and full-space invariant basis; **D** made duplicate-arc policy precise (`InvalidModelError`, weight change = remove+re-add); **E** added `errors.py` typed hierarchy to in-scope #1; **F** added explicit `bounds` no-overclaim rule (truncated ⇒ `complete=False`); **G** pinned SCC to the reachability graph; **B** pinned `firing_sequence_to` returns sequence-or-`None` with `complete`/`reason`; **J** made placeholder `test_petri_net.py` deletion explicit; **K** pinned `place_order`/`transition_order` determinism rule. `CURRENT_STATE.md` iter-0 decision references updated (D1–D11, D4 marked locked). No implementation.
- **iter 6 (2026-08-22)** — applied review-driven doc patch (no src/, no feature; user said "apply patch"). Resolved review findings: **(a)** named excluded DoD item §40-18 (Coverability for unbounded nets = v2, already out of scope via D5 + `coverability.py` stub) in Success criteria; **(b)** pinned `max_states` as required (no implicit default) in D9, and added model-API semantics (`reset()` restores `M0`; `fire_marking(M,t)` raises `TransitionNotEnabledError` when disabled) in In-scope #1; **(c)** added a per-function test-coverage matrix (happy + "unknown" for every analysis fn) to In-scope #5; **(d)** added feature_001 runtime-mutation cross-ref to D11 (confirm add-only vs add+remove before lock); **(e)** added a "Lock sign-off checklist" (single-action approval) and a "Design-phase must-pin checklist" (analyzer binding, AnalysisResult fields, fire_marking/reset/max_states semantics, test matrix). Scope remains draft, awaiting the lock sign-off. `CURRENT_STATE.md` iter-6 entry added. No implementation.
- **iter 7 (2026-08-22)** — full project-home review fix set (markdown only; user: "fix all"). Resolved the 2026-08-22 review findings: **(1) stale feature slug (critical)** — `feature_030` is taken by `feature_030.project_lifecycle`; D1 rewritten so the number is auto-assigned at scaffold (`new_feature.py` computes max+1; next free **031**); all slug references updated (Status, lock checklist, must-pin heading, out-of-scope reminders, iter-1 historical fact marked stale). **(2) CURRENT_STATE consistency** — iter-3 overclaim corrected (only D4 is locked; D5–D11 remain draft), session-log gaps backfilled (iter-2 and iter-4 blocks added; iter-0 ≡ PROJECT.md iter-1 offset noted). **(3)** scaffold command carries `--project petri_net_library` everywhere. **(4) `__init__.py` decision aligned to the verified model/ convention** (docstring-only, no re-exports; must-pin #7 resolved). **(5) section map closed** — §35 in v1, §26 explicitly v2, §36 split (v1 checklist items in / advanced items out), §41 marked principle-not-scope; References + lock-checklist split updated to match. **(6)** iter-5 review letters H, I, L, M disposition recorded: not adopted, no outstanding action (retroactive closure — correct if wrong). **(7)** TA comments normalized (doubled category tokens removed). **(8)** header bumped to iter 7. Scope remains draft, awaiting lock sign-off. No src/, no feature.

<!-- TA: xref: v1 SHIPPED 2026-08-23 (feature_031 Done) — src/agentx/model/petri_net/ EXISTS (errors/model/analysis/coverability/__init__); tests/model/petri_net/ has the real suite (June placeholder deleted); feature_001.session_user_objectives_driven_by_Petri_Net remains the FUTURE CONSUMER, not this project's scope (D11). -->
<!-- TA: risk: requirement doc §17/§39 — a truncated BFS must NEVER be reported as "unbounded" or "deadlock-free"; only coverability-tree analysis can prove unboundedness. The tests must include "unknown" cases (doc §40-19), not just happy paths. Design phase must pin the AnalysisResult(value: bool|None, complete, explored_states, reason) contract before any analysis function is written. -->
<!-- TA: gotcha: doc §18 recommends sympy for exact invariant nullspace, but D4 LOCKS to pure-Python rational Gaussian elimination (zero deps). Do not silently implement invariants with numpy floating-point nullspace — doc §18 explicitly rejects float rank/null-space for Petri-net invariants. -->

- **Requirement doc (the anchor)** — `.meta/doc/petri_nets/petri_net_python_coding_agents.md`. 41 sections covering foundations (§1–2), model layer (§3–10), analysis layer (§11–25), design rules (§26–34), structure (§35), minimum feature set (§36), end-to-end example (§37), edge cases (§38), no-overclaiming (§39), Definition of Done (§40), final mental model (§41). **v1 scope: §1–16, §18–21, §23–24, §27–35, §36 (v1 checklist items only), §40 items 1–17, 19 only; §26 → v2; §41 = guiding principle, not scoped.**
- **feature_001 requirement** — `.meta/software_development_process/2.requirements/features/feature_001.session_user_objectives_driven_by_Petri_Net/FEATURE.md`. The future consumer: agentx internal state in `src/agentx/model/internal_state`, adaptive Petri net, structure updated when `local_sessions/current/USER_OBJECTIVES.md` CRC changes.
- **Harness project-home convention** — `.meta/META_HARNESS.omt:184-185` + `:208`. `.projects/meta/<feature>/{PROJECT.md, CURRENT_STATE.md}` non-gated; PROJECT.md canonical, CURRENT_STATE.md session log + resume point; companion to the phase-gated design doc.
- **Sibling project for convention** — `.projects/meta/rag_v2/PROJECT.md` (project-home structure: Summary → Purpose → Vision → Scope matrix → Status → Decisions → Iteration log → References) and `.projects/meta/meta_harness_3/CURRENT_STATE.md` (session-log format).
