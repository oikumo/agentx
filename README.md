## What is agentx?

**agentx** is a Python-based LLM agent framework with a modern **Textual TUI** and **console REPL** interface, created strictly for educational purposes. It lets you interact with language models through chat, web search, PDF Q&A, function calling, and graph-based reasoning workflows.

## 📖 META HARNESS: Process Enforcement System

> **Why this matters:** agentx isn't just an LLM agent framework — it's a working proof that a coding agent can be mechanically constrained to follow a rigorous software development process (Analysis → Design → Programming → Testing) with visible, auditable artifacts at every step. No manual discipline required.

agentx is developed with **opencode** using a mechanically enforced **META HARNESS** — the OMT++ (Object Modeling Technique++) process enforcement system. Every code change follows a structured workflow with visible artifacts, enforced by plugins, linters, and gates — not human willpower.

### Components

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Documentation Structure** | `.meta/` | All development artifacts organized by OMT++ phases |
| **Enforcement Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_enforcer.ts` + `.opencode/lib/enforcer/` | Composition root + gate modules driven by `gate_driver.ts` (HDL-2): an IR-ordered chain of 10 gates (budget 12, net-zero) whose order, triggers, predicates, and messages are pure `.omt` declarations |
| **Status Tool** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_status.ts` | Returns current phase, unlock state, artifact status, TDD state (compact ~350 B/call) + `preflight(tool,path)` ordered gates (feature_055, preflight-on-declare 062) + `resume` ≤2 KB digest (feature_092) |
| **Navigation Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_nav.ts` | feature_020 + 061/069: structured doc navigation via ONE consolidated tool — `omt_nav{op:nav\|list_sections\|cross_ref\|quick_ref}` (cached hits, answer caps) |
| **Interrogative Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_q.ts` | feature_026 + 077/078: read-only resume questions — `op:state` · `op:plan` · `op:drift` · `op:audit` · `op:graph` — answering "state of X / which gates block / what drifted / historical replay / transitive risk" without re-derivation (JSON envelope + `as_of_commit`) |
| **Knowledge Base Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_kb_nav.ts` | Application Knowledge Base (AKB) navigation — concept-altitude `TIER_CODE` index (`g.kb` consult before `src/` edits; sticky per-feature 063, per-file recency 088) |
| **Think Anywhere Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_think.ts` | feature_021/022 + 058/066: persistent inline `TA:` thought-tags via ONE consolidated tool — `omt_think{op:add\|list\|remove\|verify\|suggest\|review}` — + session digest, batch consult |
| **Concurrency Net Plugin** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_net.ts` | feature_039–050 + MH8 T5 (079–084): Petri-net-gated concurrent development — `omt_net{op:probe\|fire\|splice\|sync\|invariant\|synthesize\|mine\|gate\|claim}`; WIP-limited pool (places 12/15, `net_rev:57` drained_complete, stable since MH8 close), net-as-gate (050), session whitelist, claim/generation fencing |
| **MVC++ Linter** | `scripts/omt/mvc_check.py` | Architecture checker for layer violations (View↔Model leaks, SQL outside DP, etc.) |
| **TDD Engine** | `scripts/omt/tdd_check.py` + `omt_tdd` tool | Mechanically enforces Red→Green→Refactor cycles (two-hats gate); **toolchain-aware** (038) — `.py`→pytest, `.ts/.tsx`→vitest; `sync` stranded-red closer (065), same-node lint (067) |
| **Feature Scaffold** | `scripts/omt/new_feature.py` | Creates consistently-named feature directories from templates |
| **Harness DSL (source of truth)** | `.meta/META_HARNESS.omt` | OMT-HDL v1: every rule, gate, tool, constant, and budget declared as records in ONE file |
| **Harness Compiler** | `scripts/omt/harnessc.py` | Projects the DSL → `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.jsonc` blocks, plugin IR, nav index; derives records at projection time; drift-tested; lints grammar vocab, tool-seed drift, message orphans, root hygiene |
| **Ledger** | `.meta/.omt/ledger.jsonl` | Audit trail of all phase declarations and completions (rotated at 64 KB) |
| **Configuration** | `opencode.jsonc`, `AGENTS.md` | Protected files, denied commands, process rules — **generated projections of the DSL, never hand-edited** |
| **Workflows Catalog** | `.workflows/` | Operational workflow playbooks the agent loads and executes on user demand — markdown recipes (NOT a runtime engine). Sits **above** the harness: each workflow's `# Rules` line 1 declares whether it follows or overrides OMT. Two-level discovery read: `.workflows/META.md` → matched subject `META.md` → matched file. Mandatory approval gate (no auto-fix). See [`.workflows/META.md`](.workflows/META.md) |
| **Projects Home** | `.projects/` | Per-feature design & project-planning home — `PROJECT.md` (canonical single-source design doc) + `CURRENT_STATE.md` (session-by-session log + resume point) + supporting artifacts. Non-gated (NOT in `harness_paths`). Companion to the phase-gated design doc under `.meta/software_development_process/4.design/features/`. Subfolders under `.projects/meta/<feature>/`. See [`.projects/meta/`](.projects/meta/) |

### Workflows (`.workflows/`)

The `.workflows/` catalog holds **human-authored triggered procedures** — operational playbooks the coding agent loads and executes on demand. A workflow is a markdown recipe: a problem statement, a `# Rules` list, and a numbered `# <Strategy>` the agent follows step by step. It is **not** a runtime engine (no DAG executor, no `src/` parser, no event bus) and it is **not** a replacement for OMT — it sits *above* the harness and decides when to invoke it.

**Subjects** namespace the catalog by area of the codebase:

| Subject | Path | State |
|---------|------|-------|
| `agentx` | `.workflows/agentx/` | active — 2 loops (`consistency_enforcement`, `feature_fix`) |
| `meta_harness` | `.workflows/meta_harness/` | active — 2 loops (`meta_harness_evolution`, `meta_harness_project`) + 1 one-shot (`pause_dev_for_resume_later`) |
| `app_knowledge_base` | `.workflows/app_knowledge_base/` | active — 1 loop (`akb_smart_population_and_update`) |

**How a trigger works** (agent-read procedure, no parser):

```text
user trigger ("feature X doesn't work, fix it")
   │
   ▼  read root manifest
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ .workflows/META.md      │  ← subjects, schema, read-order
└────────┬────────────────┘
         ▼  pick matched subject, read its META
┌───────────────────────────┐
│ .workflows/<subj>/META.md │ ← per-workflow purpose, keywords, output path
└────────┬──────────────────┘
         ▼  load the matched workflow file
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ .workflows/<subj>/loops/<wf>.md │ ← # Rules (OMT stance line 1) + # <Strategy>
└────────┬────────────────────────┘
         ▼  execute steps → MANDATORY approval gate → write result to .sandbox/
```

**OMT stance.** Each workflow's `# Rules` line 1 declares whether the harness gates apply:
- `Follow omt methodology` → `omt_phase` / `g.kb` / think-gates apply normally.
- `Do not follow the omt methodology, focus on <X>` → gates are advisory for that run (still uses `omt_think` to embed knowledge).

**Recurring invariants** (preserved across every workflow, treated as non-negotiable):
1. **Human approval is mandatory** — no workflow auto-applies a fix; the user picks the alternative at the approval gate.
2. **`omt_think` is always used** to embed knowledge in source — even when the workflow overrides OMT methodology.
3. **Automated unit tests with mocks** are the preferred verification tool.
4. **Sub-agents** are preferred for parallel analysis whenever useful.
5. **Future agent token consumption** is the primary cost to minimize (terse definitions, explicit output paths, two-level read order).

To author a new workflow: copy the template in [`.workflows/META.md`](.workflows/META.md) §6, fill it, drop it under the right subject (`loops/` for recurring, subject root for one-shot), and update that subject's `META.md` table. The full contract (schema, discovery procedure, output-path convention, the approval-gate hard invariant) lives in [`.workflows/META.md`](.workflows/META.md).

### Projects Home (`.projects/`)

The `.projects/` directory is the **per-feature design & project-planning home** — a non-gated companion to the phase-gated design doc that lives under `.meta/software_development_process/4.design/features/`. Each major feature or meta-project gets one subfolder under `.projects/meta/` holding its canonical design document plus the session-by-session log. The harness neither writes here nor gates edits: `.projects/` is not in `@var harness_paths`, not under `src/`, and not protected — the agent consults it before scoping a new feature and writes the resume point back at the end of each session.

**Per-feature folder layout:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Canonical single-source design doc — vision, scope, architecture, acceptance criteria, implementation plan, decision log. On any disagreement with the companion file below, `PROJECT.md` wins. |
| `CURRENT_STATE.md` | Session-by-session log — what was done, must-survive gotchas, and the precise "start here" resume point for the next session. |
| Supporting artifacts | Samples, backups, superseded earlier drafts (e.g. `design_001_*.md` marked SUPERSEDED). |

**Existing project folders (`.projects/meta/`, see `WORK.md` `## Projects` — synced by `uv run scripts/omt/project.py sync`):**

| Folder | Subject | State |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `agentx_concurrent_development` | Concurrent development | draft |
| `feature_kb_akb/` | Application Knowledge Base (AKB) | draft (UNIFIED concept-altitude index, `g.kb` consult-gate wired — DONE 2026-08-08) |
| `workflows/` | `.workflows/` catalog definition layer | draft (root + 3 per-subject `META.md` + authoring schema + 3 open-gap fixes — DONE 2026-08-08) |
| `petri_net_studio/` | Petri Net Studio v1/v2/v3 (feature_032–036) | active |
| `project_lifecycle/` | Project lifecycle (feature_030) | active |
| `rag_v2/` | RAG v2 (feature_027, feature_029 slash commands) | active |
| `petri_net_library/` | Shared Petri net contract (feature_031) | complete |
| `net_enforced_harness/` | Net-as-gate (feature_050) | complete |
| `meta_harness_concurrent/` | Adaptive net engine + composition + WIP pool + dashboard (feature_039–049) | complete |
| `meta_harness_2/` … `meta_harness_9/` | Harness evolution programs (nav/think/TDD/interrogative → MH9 rebase + benchmark + thin work contract + frontier) | complete (2–9; MH8 065–096 + MH9 097–101 closed 2026-09-14) |

**Relationship to the phase-gated design doc.** `@phase design_req` (in `.meta/META_HARNESS.omt`) requires a design doc on disk for `major_feature`/`new_screen`. The phase gate's `resolveArtifact` accepts an explicit `design_doc=` argument first (any path that exists), else auto-detects under `.meta/software_development_process/4.design/features/<feature>/`. Pointing `omt_phase{design_doc:".projects/meta/<feature>/PROJECT.md"}` makes the richer `PROJECT.md` the canonical artifact while the auto-detected `design_001_*.md` stub acts as a pointer — both paths satisfy the gate; the `.projects/` folder is the richer of the two by convention.

To start a new project folder: create `.projects/meta/<feature_slug>/` and seed `PROJECT.md` (purpose, scope, acceptance criteria) + `CURRENT_STATE.md` (empty or with a session-1 placeholder). The phase-gated design doc scaffold is created separately by `uv run scripts/omt/new_feature.py "<name>" --type major_feature`. The full contract (component + path records) is nav-indexed under `COMP_PROJECTS` / `PTH_PROJECTS` in `.meta/META_HARNESS.omt`.

### Single Source of Truth: the META HARNESS DSL (OMT-HDL)

Every rule above — deny lists, protected paths, gates and their execution order, tool schemas, TDD state machines, doc structure, size budgets — is declared in **one file**: [`.meta/META_HARNESS.omt`](.meta/META_HARNESS.omt) (OMT-HDL v1: 265 records, `harnessc check OK` 2026-09-14 — including records the compiler *derives* at projection time instead of hand-maintaining).

A compiler projects that single source into everything the runtime and the agent consume:

```text
 .meta/META_HARNESS.omt   ← the ONLY file you edit
           │
           ▼  uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py build
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │ GENERATED PROJECTIONS (never hand-edit — drift-tested)       │
 │  • AGENTS.md ................ agent rules (budget ≤ 2.5 KiB) │
 │  • opencode.jsonc blocks .... deny/permission rules          │
 │  • .meta/.omt/harness.ir.json  IR consumed by the TS plugins │
 │  • .meta/.omt/nav.index.jsonl  omt_nav search index          │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py check` | Validate the `.omt` (schema, refs, budgets) |
| `uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py check --verify-projections` | **Drift test** — fails if any projection is stale or hand-edited |
| `uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py build` | Regenerate all projections from the `.omt` |

**Why a DSL?** Constants such as the ledger rotation cap used to live in three places (TS plugin, Python engine, docs). Now `@var` records single-source them — with `{@var.x}` interpolation across records (unknown names are check errors) — and both the TypeScript plugins and the Python engine consume the compiled IR at runtime (7 hand-mirrored constant blocks deleted; pin-tests assert TS == PY == `.omt`). Gate execution order, nav-gate doc paths, and size budgets (AGENTS.md ≤ 2944 B · WORK.md ≤ 8192 B · scratchpad ≤ 3072 B · tool schemas ≤ 1856 B · tool arg describes ≤ 2464 B · gates ≤ 12 · nav-index ≤ 65536 B · IR ≤ 20480 B) are likewise declared once and mechanically verified on every build.

### Token Discipline: every byte that costs tokens is budgeted

A process harness that eats the context window would defeat its own purpose. Every surface that rides the system prompt or session startup carries a `@budget` enforced by `harnessc check` (improvement006 A–H + improvement007 A–I):

| Surface | Before | Now | Paid |
|---------|--------|-----|------|
| Tool schemas | 1484 B across **18 tools** | **1840 B across 10 tools** (budget 1856) | every turn |
| Live arg `describe()`s | 1609 B | **2455 B** (budget 2464) | every turn |
| `AGENTS.md` | 5120 B cap | **≤ 2944 B** (2918 B live 2026-09-14) | every turn |
| `WORK.md` | 14 KiB cap, unbounded DONE log | **≤ 8192 B** — pending + last-5 DONE inline, older rotate to `WORK_ARCHIVE.md` (7871 B live) | every session |
| `omt_status` output | ~1.5 KB/call | **~350 B/call** | on demand |

> **Note on the tool count:** the 18→7 consolidation target predates the later additive harness tools. feature_026 added `omt_q` (interrogative layer), the AKB `omt_kb_nav` grew the family, and feature_039 added `omt_net` (concurrency net) — now **10 tools** (`omt_phase`/`omt_skip`/`omt_complete`/`omt_status`/`omt_tdd`/`omt_nav`/`omt_kb_nav`/`omt_think`/`omt_q`/`omt_net`), pushing `@budget tool_schemas` 1024→1280→1536→1856 B — a deliberate trade: read-only + net tools that collapse per-session re-derivation and serialize concurrent work into deterministic calls.

**Foundations (improvement006/007 era, still current):**

- **HDL-2 gate driver** — the before-gate chain iterates IR-declared gates in `order=`, matching `tools=` and evaluating `when=` via a `@pred` registry; after-gates (MVC++ lint, TDD auto-revert) run in the same driver. A new *simple* gate is now a pure `.omt` declaration — no TypeScript to write.
- **Derive at projection time** — `PHASE_*` / `TT_*` / `SECTION` nav records (and 13 more) are emitted by the compiler; hand-maintained duplicates pruned, killing a whole drift class.
- **New compile-time lints** — grammar-vocab check (fsm/hat/gate arity), tool seed-drift check (TS seed strings ≡ `.omt` payloads), gate-message orphan check, repo-root hygiene check (allowlisted top level).
- **On-demand doc diet** — `META_HARNESS.md` 5.5→1.4 KB (stub rotation), `META.md` 6.8→5.0 KB, methodology guide 27.5→23.9 KB with nav cross-ref routes widened 6→16.

**Last changes (MH6 → MH9, 2026-09-06 → 14 — all CLOSED, `check` 265/0, suite 2241/2241):**

- **MH6 (051–059, closed 2026-09-06)** — gate usability: ledger isolation, version canary, concurrency predicate, small-task fast-path, `preflight`, skip taxonomy, ceremony meter, thought-review, tiered template.
- **MH7 (060–064/066, closed 2026-09-12)** — active-only dangling, nav cache hit, preflight-on-declare, KB sticky per-feature, truthful observation, think batch consult.
- **MH8 (065–096, 31 items, closed 2026-09-14)** — the big hardening wave: TDD `sync` + same-node lint, schema autolink, nav caps, escape/delegate folds, typed policy, task-prep slice, receipt batch mode, completion hardening, workflow repair (6/6), temporal replay (`op:audit`), graph risk (`op:graph`), transaction authority, claim generation, worktree isolation, capacity arbitration, verification lane, recovery journal, evidence deps, skip audit, KB recency, structural pins, scaffolds/LSP allowlist, budget-diet-bot (warns at ≤64 B headroom), resume digest (`op:resume` ≤2 KB), cost benchmark (093: 17 goldens + 6/6 first-numbers TP=13/FP=0), verifiable-knowledge pilot (094: advisory sidecar only), fresh-review loop (095/096: 0 wins).
- **MH9 (097–101, closed 2026-09-14)** — rebase + isolation pins → honest-cost follow-up → truthful-boundary residual → thin work contract → frontier experiment (verdict MERGE: fold enabled-ordering into preflight text; Petri stays analysis-only).
- **Net stable** — no new net topology since 050; `net_rev:57` drained_complete, pool places 12/15, pending 0 / active 0 / done 7.

### How Enforcement Works

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Coarse permissions** | `opencode.jsonc` | Declarative deny/allow rules (git commit, bare python, .env edits, etc.) |
| **Fine process gate** | `.opencode/plugins/omt_enforcer.ts` + `.opencode/lib/enforcer/gate_driver.ts` | IR-ordered gate chain — before edits: nav → protect → receipt → tests-canary → phase → think; after edits: MVC++ lint → TDD revert |

**The META HARNESS Gate:** Before editing any file under `src/`, you **must** declare your OMT++ phase:

```text
omt_phase{ task_type: "bug_fix|minor_feature|major_feature|new_screen|refactor|test|docs", 
           phase: "Analysis|Design|Programming|Testing",
           scope: "one sentence: what 'done' looks like" }
```

This creates a ledger entry in `.meta/.omt/ledger.jsonl` and unlocks `src/` edits for the session.

**Rigor scales to task size:**

| task_type | Required Artifacts |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `bug_fix` / `minor_feature` / `refactor` | Phase declaration only |
| `major_feature` / `new_screen` | Phase declaration **+** design doc on disk |

**Automatic Architecture Checks:** After every `src/` edit, an after-gate runs the MVC++ linter (`uv run scripts/omt/mvc_check.py`) which checks for View↔Model layer leaks, non-ABC Abstract Partners, SQL outside Data Provider classes, and God controllers (>300 lines). **Newly introduced** hard violations are **blocked** fix-forward (delta vs a pre-edit snapshot — legacy code is never punished); pre-existing issues surface as non-blocking advisories.

### TDD Enforcement (feature_016)

For `major_feature` and `new_screen` tasks, the gate automatically activates **TDD mode** — a Kent Beck-style Red → Green → Refactor cycle enforced mechanically via `omt_tdd{op:testlist→red→green→refactor→done}`:

```text
  ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
  │  TESTLIST    │ →   │  RED (test)  │ →   │  GREEN (code)   │
  │  behaviors   │     │  write test  │     │  write code     │
  │  to implement│     │  that FAILS  │     │  to make it PASS│
  └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
                                         ┌──────────────────┐
                                         │  REFACTOR        │

                                         │  tests stay GREEN│
                                         └──────────────────┘
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
                                         ┌─────────────────┐
                                         │  DONE           │
                                         │  full suite +   │
                                         │  checklist pass │
                                         └─────────────────┘
```

**Two-Hats Gate:** RED state → only `tests/` edits allowed; GREEN/REFACTOR state → only `src/` edits allowed. Wrong layer edit → gate blocks with a message telling you which hat to switch to.

**REFACTOR Revert:** If a refactor edit breaks tests, the gate automatically reverts the file to its pre-edit state — you can't accidentally introduce a regression during refactoring.

### Navigation Enforcement (feature_020)

Before answering ANY question about the project (classes, components, features, architecture), agents MUST use the navigation tool (`omt_nav{op:nav|list_sections|cross_ref|quick_ref}`) to search META HARNESS documentation first — only falling back to `grep`/`glob` if navigation returns no results. A mechanical gate (first in the IR-ordered chain) blocks `grep`/`glob` on doc paths (`.meta/`, `AGENTS.md`, `WORK.md`) until a nav op is used.

### Think Anywhere (feature_021/022)

Persistent, grep-friendly `TA:` thought-tags dropped **inline in any non-protected file** so hard-won context (gotchas, "why this is here", risks, cross-refs) survives across sessions. Token-minimal: retrieval is O(hits) via `grep`/`omt_think{op:list}`.

- **`omt_think{op:add}`** — insert a language-aware `TA:` comment (bypasses phase/canary gates; annotation, not code)
- **`omt_think{op:list}`** — grep-backed retrieval; marks the session consulted (clears the think-gate)
- **`omt_think{op:remove}`** — remove a `TA:` line + reconcile the JSONL index (`verify`/`suggest` ops also available)
- **Think-gate (blocking):** editing a file that carries `TA:` thoughts is blocked until the agent consults via `omt_think{op:list}` — NOT bypassable by `omt_skip`
- **Session digest:** the first tool result of each session carries a compact, capped digest (counts + per-file counts + stale ⚠️ + pointer)

### Tooling

**Ten consolidated opencode tools** (18 → 7, then +`omt_q` +`omt_kb_nav` +`omt_net` → 10 — schema cost 1484→1840 B, budget 1856):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `omt_phase` | Declare OMT++ phase; unlocks `src/` edits |
| `omt_skip` | Logged process-override escape hatch (scopes: src/tests/nav/all) |
| `omt_complete` | Verify phase artifacts + advance to next phase |
| `omt_status` | Process context: phase, TDD state, lint, valid next phases (compact) + `preflight` (055/062) + `resume` ≤2 KB digest (092) |
| `omt_q` | **Interrogative layer (026 + 077/078)** — read-only: `op:state` (feature/session context), `op:plan` (which gates would block), `op:drift` (stale projections), `op:audit` + `op:graph` (history / transitive risk); JSON envelope with `as_of_commit` |
| `omt_tdd` | TDD cycle driver — `op:testlist` → `red` → `green` → `refactor` → `done` + `op:sync` (065); **toolchain-aware (038)** — `.py`→pytest, `.ts/.tsx`→vitest; same-node lint (067) |
| `omt_nav` | Navigate META HARNESS docs — `op:nav` · `list_sections` · `cross_ref` · `quick_ref` (feature_020) |
| `omt_kb_nav` | Application Knowledge Base (AKB) navigation — `op:nav` · `list_sections` · `cross_ref` · `quick_ref` (TIER_CODE concept-altitude index) |
| `omt_think` | Persistent inline `TA:` thought-tags — `op:add` · `list` · `remove` · `verify` · `suggest` · `review` (021/022 + 058/066) |
| `omt_net` | **Concurrency net (039–050 + MH8 T5 079–084)** — `op:probe` · `fire` · `splice` · `sync` · `invariant` · `synthesize` · `mine` · `gate` · `claim` — WIP pool (`net_rev:57` stable), net-as-gate, drift checks |

Command-line engines:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `uv run scripts/omt/mvc_check.py` | MVC++ architecture linter |
| `uv run scripts/omt/tdd_check.py` | TDD enforcement engine (9 subcommands) |
| `uv run scripts/omt/new_feature.py "<name>"` | Scaffold a feature's artifacts from `.meta/templates/` |
| `uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py check / build` | Harness DSL compiler: validate `.omt` (schema, grammar vocab, budgets, seed/msg/hygiene lints), drift-test projections, regenerate |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14 or later
- `uv` package manager — install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- At least one API key (OpenRouter recommended — see Configuration below)

### Option 1: Development Mode (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oikumo/agentx.git
cd agentx
uv sync
uv run agentx
```

### Option 2: Global Install (run from anywhere)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oikumo/agentx.git
uv tool install --editable agentx
agentx        # run from anywhere
```

Uninstall with `uv tool uninstall agentx`.

You'll see the console interface (the default). Commands: `c` for chat, `r` for RAG, `m` for models, `q` to quit. To launch the TUI instead: `uv run agentx --tui`. `--no-tui` is still accepted (no-op) for backwards compatibility.

### 💬 AI Chat

Multi-provider LLM support with streaming responses:

**Supported Providers:**
| Provider | Models | Config |
|----------|--------|--------|
| OpenRouter | 100+ models (auto-routing) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | Gemini Pro | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| NVIDIA NIM | Nemotron, Llama models | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` |
| Ollama | Local models | `OLLAMA_HOST` |
| LlamaCpp | Local GGUF models | Manual config |

Use the **Models screen** (press `m` from the main TUI) to select the active provider at runtime. The selection is persisted to `~/.agentx/model_selection.json` and used across chat, RAG, and agent features.

**Example Conversation:**
```text
(agentx) > chat

Welcome to Chat! Type your message or 'quit' to exit.

You: Explain dependency injection in Python

Assistant: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where...
           [streaming response continues]

You: Can you show an example?

Assistant: Sure! Here's a simple example using constructor injection:

           class Database:
               def query(self): ...
           
           class UserService:
               def __init__(self, db: Database):
                   self.db = db  # ← injected dependency

You: quit
(agentx) > 
```

### 📚 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

Ask questions about your documents, PDFs, and web pages using vector search.

**RAG Workflow:**
```text
1. Create Repository
   └─→ (agentx) > rag
       └─→ [n] New repository: "my-docs"

2. Ingest Documents
   └─→ [i] Ingest URL: https://example.com/guide.pdf
       └─→ Fetch → Parse (PyPDF) → Chunk → Embed → Store (Chroma)

3. Chat with Repository
   └─→ [c] Chat: "What does the guide say about authentication?"
       └─→ Query vector DB → Inject context → LLM response
```

**Supported Vector Stores:**
- Chroma (default)
- FAISS (CPU)
- Pinecone (cloud)

**Ingestion Sources:**
- PDF files (PyPDF)
- Web URLs (Tavily search)
- Local documents

### 🤖 Intelligent Agent (feature_007)

An autonomous agent subsystem that runs a **perceive → decide → act → reflect → persist** cycle, with a tool registry, a policy DSL engine, and a reflection/self-improvement loop.

**Agent Cycle:**
```text
         ┌──────────┐
         │ perceive │ ← sensors read environment + tool readings
         └────┬─────┘
              ▼
         ┌──────────┐
         │ decide   │ ← policy engine evaluates rules → action
         └────┬─────┘
              ▼
         ┌──────────┐
         │ act      │ ← actuator executes tool command
         └────┬─────┘
              ▼
         ┌──────────┐
         │ reflect  │ ← AI critiques trace → proposals (safety-checked)
         └────┬─────┘
              ▼
         ┌──────────┐
         │ persist  │ ← snapshot to SQLite (memory, goals, policies, reflection log)
         └──────────┘
```

**Core Subsystems:**

| Subsystem | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tool Registry** | `ISensor`/`IActuator` interfaces, `ToolSpec` schema, discovery, and built-in tools (FileSystem, RAG query, Session) |
| **Policy Engine** | Condition DSL (tokenizer → AST → visitor), priority resolution, conflict detection, adaptation hooks |
| **Reflection Engine** | Critique parser, safety evaluator (deny-list), proposal router, approval flow |
| **Goal Manager** | Hierarchical goal trees with success criteria and status tracking |
| **Memory Manager** | Volatile + persistent memory with metadata and source tracking |
| **Persistence** | stdlib `sqlite3` (no ORM, no Alembic) — schema, agent DB, and repositories |

**Advanced Agent Screen (TUI):**

Press `a` from the main screen to open the full-featured agent workspace:

| Key / Command | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `r` / `run` | Run one agent cycle |
| `s` / `save` | Save session snapshot |
| `d` / `demo [a\|b]` | Open the demo screen |
| `goal <desc>` | Submit a new goal |
| `rule <cond> \| <action> <json>` | Add a policy rule |
| `status` / `goals` / `rules` / `memory` | Inspect agent state |
| `proposals` / `approve <id> <idx>` | View and approve reflection proposals |

**Self-Improvement Loop:**

The reflection engine critiques each cycle's trace and may propose changes (new policy rules, goal adjustments, tool enablement). Proposals are safety-evaluated and held as **pending** until approved via the `approve` command — closing the self-improvement loop without uncontrolled autonomy.

---

### ⚡ Fast Agent (feature_011)

A streamlined, modal-dialog-driven agent UX for quick tasks. Press `f` from the main screen:

```text
┌─ Fast Agent ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚡ Goal: What do you want the agent to do?                  │
│  [Advanced ▸] (optional constraints)                        │
│  [ Start ]  [ Cancel ]                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓
┌─ Running ───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓ (on self-improvement proposal)
┌─ Reflection ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ▸ Proposal: Add rule "skip /tmp"                           │
│     because: caught noisy readings                          │
│  [✓ Approve] [✕ Dismiss] [⏹ Stop]                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
      ↓
┌─ Result ────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ Goal achieved in 4 cycles                                │
│  [💾 Save session]  [⚡ New goal]  [← Back to menu]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Differences from Advanced Agent:**

| Aspect | Fast Agent (`f`) | Advanced Agent (`a`) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Goal input | Single natural-language prompt | Hierarchical goal tree editor |
| Policy rules | Hidden (auto/off) | Full DSL editor |
| Cycle execution | Auto-run (call_after_refresh) | Manual `r` key / `run` command |
| Proposals | Modal interrupt (Approve/Dismiss/Stop) | `proposals` / `approve` commands |
| Goal completion | Manual (Stop when done) | Auto via SuccessCriteria |
| Best for | Quick one-shot tasks | Complex multi-goal workflows |

The Fast Agent reuses the same `Agent` facade + `AgentController` under the hood — zero Model-layer changes. It's the first use of `textual.screen.ModalScreen` in the codebase.

### 🎛️ Models Screen (feature_013)

A runtime AI model provider selector accessible from the main TUI screen (press `m`):

```text
┌─ Models ────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Select your AI model provider:                             │
│                                                             │
│  ● OpenRouter (cloud)     — 100+ models, auto-routing       │
│    OpenAI (cloud)         — GPT-4, GPT-3.5                  │
│    Google Gemini (cloud)  — Gemini Pro                      │
│    NVIDIA NIM (cloud)     — Nemotron, Llama                 │
│    Ollama (local)         — Local models                    │
│    LlamaCpp (local)       — Local GGUF models               │
│                                                             │
│  [Enter] Select  [Esc/b] Back                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The selected provider is persisted to `~/.agentx/model_selection.json` and used across all features (chat, RAG, agent, ReAct). The registry uses a unified `LLMProvider` ABC with lazy imports — adding a new provider is a single class + one catalog entry.

---

### 🧠 ReAct Screen (feature_018)

A new **Reasoning + Acting** chat screen that uses LangChain's `create_agent` (ReAct pattern) to show the agent's **thinking process**, **tool calls**, and **streaming answers** in real-time.

```text
┌─ ReAct ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Key Features:**
- 💭 **Thinking** — Visible chain-of-thought reasoning from the agent
- 🔧 **Tool calls** — See which tools the agent uses and with what arguments
- 📊 **Tool results** — Tool outputs displayed inline
- 💬 **Streaming answers** — Final response streams token-by-token
- 🧠 **Context preservation** — Multi-turn conversations via LangGraph checkpointer
- 🛑 **Non-blocking UI** — Agent runs on background thread; `Esc`/`q` always responsive

**Built-in Tools:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `calculator` | Safe math evaluation (AST-based, no `eval`) |
| `get_current_time` | Returns current ISO 8601 timestamp |

**Architecture:**
- **Model**: `ReactAgentService` wraps `langchain.agents.create_agent` with `InMemorySaver` checkpointer
- **Controller**: `ReactController` implements `IReactViewPartner`; spawns daemon worker thread for agent streaming
- **View**: `ReactTUIScreen` extends `BaseAgentXScreen`; displays thinking/tool/answer blocks with distinct styling
- **Integration**: Added `t` binding + 🧠 ReAct button to Main screen; MenuGrid expanded to 3×3 (7 buttons)

**Key Bindings:**
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `t` | Open ReAct screen |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send message |
| `Esc` / `q` | Return to Main (cancels running agent) |

### 💻 Coding Agent Screen (feature_019)

A new **Coding Agent** chat screen that uses LangChain's `create_agent` with file system tools to search, read, edit, list, and create files in your workspace — with visible thinking, tool calls, and diff highlighting.

```text
┌─ Coding ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

**Key Features:**
- 💭 **Thinking** — Visible chain-of-thought reasoning from the agent
- 🔧 **Tool calls** — See which file tools the agent uses with arguments
- 📊 **Tool results** — Tool outputs displayed inline with diff highlighting for edits
- 💬 **Streaming answers** — Final response streams token-by-token
- 🧠 **Context preservation** — Multi-turn conversations via LangGraph checkpointer
- 🛑 **Non-blocking UI** — Agent runs on background thread; `Esc`/`q` always responsive
- 🔒 **Sandbox-rooted** — All file operations confined to session working directory
 
**Built-in Tools:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `file_search` | Glob pattern file search within sandbox |
| `file_read` | Read file with optional line range |
| `file_edit` | Precise edit (old_str must match exactly once) |
| `file_list` | List directory contents (recursive optional) |
| `file_create` | Create new file with content |
 
**Architecture:**
- **Model**: `CodingAgentService` wraps `langchain.agents.create_agent` with 5 file tools + `InMemorySaver` checkpointer
- **Controller**: `CodingController` implements `ICodingViewPartner`; spawns daemon worker thread for agent streaming
- **View**: `CodingTUIScreen` extends `BaseAgentXScreen`; displays thinking/tool/answer blocks with diff highlighting
- **Integration**: Added `d` binding + 💻 Coding button to Main screen; MenuGrid grew to 8 buttons (Coding added on top of the 3×3 ReAct layout)
 
**Key Bindings:**
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `d` | Open Coding screen |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send message |
| `Ctrl+N` | New conversation |
| `Esc` / `q` | Return to Main (cancels running agent) |

### 🎬 Agent Demo (feature_010)

Built-in demo scenarios that seed the agent sandbox with files, goals, and policies — perfect for exploring the agent cycle without configuration.

```text
┌─ Agent Demo ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Run]    Run the seeded scenario cycle                     │
│  [Reset]  Clear state and re-seed                           │
│  [Back]   Return to agent screen                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two scenarios are available (`demo a` / `demo b`), each with pre-configured goals, policy rules, and sandbox files.

---

### 🧠 Session Management (Petri Net Driven)

**feature_001**: The session lifecycle (create → active → switch) is implemented with SQLite persistence. Petri-net-driven **user objective** management is in progress — the `GoalManager` is currently a stub awaiting full integration.

**Session Lifecycle:**
```text
┌──────────────┐
│  NO SESSION  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │ new [name]
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│  CREATING    │ → Creates timestamped directory
│              │ → Initializes SQLite database
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   ACTIVE     │ → Commands recorded to session.db
│              │ → RAG repos stored in rag/
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       └─→ new [name] → Switch to new session
```

**Persistence:**
```text
local_sessions/
└── 2026-06-27_18-30-00_my-session/
    ├── session.db          # SQLite: command history
    └── rag/
        └── my-pdf-docs/
            ├── db/         # Chroma vector store
            └── docs/       # Ingested PDFs

### 🖥️ Petri Net Studio (feature_034/035/036)

A **standalone browser-based Petri net workbench** at [`tools/petri-net-studio/`](tools/petri-net-studio/) — a Vite + React + TypeScript app that is **independent of agentx at runtime** (zero agentx/harness imports; `shared/petri-net/` is the only coupling). Its TypeScript engine is an exact behavioral port of the Python model (`src/agentx/model/petri_net/`), with golden byte-parity on the canonical JSON format.

Shipped in three roadmap stages (project [`petri_net_studio`](.projects/meta/petri_net_studio/)):

| Stage | Feature | What shipped |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **v1 — Editor** | feature_034 | TS engine port (`model`/`io`/`errors`, golden byte-parity), zustand store, React Flow **edit/simulate** UI (draw → set tokens/weights → click-to-fire with enabled highlighting → export/re-import identical canonical JSON), strict-JSON parser |
| **v2 — Analysis** | feature_035 | Exact-parity **analysis engine** (`fraction.ts` exact rationals + `analysis.ts`: reachability, deadlock, bounds, liveness, SCC, P/T-invariants) + a no-overclaim `AnalysisPanel` with `maxStates` dial + a canonical **conformance-vector generator** (9 vectors @ `shared/petri-net/conformance/analysis-v1/`) |
| **v3 — Graph** | feature_036 | **Reachability-graph explorer** (`GraphExplorer`) with elkjs auto-layout, SCC coloring, deadlock highlight, truncation banner; **firing-sequence animation** (Play/Step/Reset); liveness/SCC views; example **Gallery**; `npm run conformance` formalization |

**Engine parity guarantees:** deterministic code-point ordering everywhere, hand-rolled `fraction.ts` (no floats in the algebra path), line-for-line port of the Python `_explore` reachability loop, and conformance vectors that are byte-identical across re-runs (pinned by `npm run conformance`).

```bash
cd tools/petri-net-studio
npm install
npm run dev       # launch the studio in the browser
npm run test      # Vitest suite (283 tests across 14 files: model/io/analysis/projection/store/dashboard/conformance)
npm run build     # typecheck (tsc) + static dist/ build
npm run conformance  # regenerate conformance vectors + assert byte-identical + run suite
npm run check-independence  # assert no cross-boundary src/ imports
```

### 🔌 LangChain & LangGraph Integration

Full integration with the LangChain ecosystem:

- **LangChain** (1.3.14): Chains, prompts, output parsers
- **LangGraph** (1.2.10): Graph-based agentic workflows
- **LangChain Experimental** (0.4.2): Advanced features
- **Integrations**: Community (0.4.2), OpenAI, OpenRouter, Google-GenAI, NVIDIA, Tavily, Pinecone, Chroma, Ollama + `deepagents` (0.7.5)

**Already in use:** The ReAct (`t`) and Coding (`d`) screens run on LangChain's `create_agent` with a LangGraph `InMemorySaver` checkpointer for multi-turn context. The agent subsystem (`a`) wraps its own perceive→decide→act→reflect cycle. Custom user-defined LangGraph state machines are a future roadmap item.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Keys

agentx requires at least an **OpenRouter API key** to run the default chat agent. Other features may need additional keys.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required for default chat
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For web search agents
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For OpenAI models
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For Google Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For NVIDIA NIM models
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_key_here

# For Ollama (local models)
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

**Get API Keys:**
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Tavily: https://app.tavily.com/
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Google: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## 🏗️ Architecture

### MVC++ Pattern with Abstract Partners

agentx follows a strict **MVC++** (Model-View-Controller) architecture with dependency inversion through **Abstract Partner** interfaces:

```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **Abstract Partner**: View↔Controller communication via ABCs
- **Command Pattern**: Main screen input dispatch
- **Provider Pattern**: Runtime UI selection (TUI vs Console)
- **Facade Pattern**: `Agent` class orchestrates all agent subsystems
- **Data Provider (DP)**: SQL encapsulation in `*_db.py` classes

**Layer Rules:**
- ✅ Model has NO imports from `ui`
- ✅ View has NO business logic
- ✅ Controller has NO rendering code
- ✅ SQL only in `DP_*` / `*_db.py` classes

## 🧪 Testing

agentx includes **2500+ comprehensive tests** covering all core modules — **2241 pytest** (agentx + meta harness, `2241 collected` 2026-09-14) plus **283 Vitest** (Petri Net Studio TS engine/suite, 14 files):

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run model tests
uv run pytest tests/model/ -v

# Run agent subsystem tests
uv run pytest tests/features/feature_007.agentx_intelligent_agent_behaviour/ -v

# Run TUI automated tests
uv run pytest tests/tui/ -v

# Run MVC++ architecture check
uv run scripts/omt/mvc_check.py

# Run TDD enforcement status check
uv run scripts/omt/tdd_check.py status

# Petri Net Studio (TS) suite
(cd tools/petri-net-studio && npm run test)

# Run with coverage (if pytest-cov installed)
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=agentx --cov-report=html
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Petri nets & session management
- ✅ Commands & controllers
- ✅ Views & adapters (console + TUI)
- ✅ AI services & RAG orchestration
- ✅ Agent tool registry (sensors, actuators, discovery)
- ✅ Policy DSL engine (parsing, evaluation, conflict detection)
- ✅ Reflection engine (critique, safety, proposal routing)
- ✅ Goal manager & memory manager
- ✅ Agent persistence (stdlib sqlite3 repositories)
- ✅ Agent facade cycle (perceive→decide→act→reflect→persist)
- ✅ Demo scenarios & Textual pilot e2e tests
- ✅ TDD enforcement engine (AST analysis, two-hats gate, coverage gap detection)
- ✅ Meta Harness navigation tools (feature_020: grep-based doc nav, plugin load safety)
- ✅ Think Anywhere thought-tags (feature_021: inline `TA:` tags, think-gate decider, session digest)
- ✅ Harness DSL & compiler (`harnessc check OK — 265 records, 0 errors`: `{@var.x}` interpolation, grammar vocab, budgets incl. diet-bot warns, TS/PY↔IR parity pins, gate driver, drift-tested projections)
- ✅ Petri Net Studio engine (Vitest 283: model/io exact parity, fraction rationals, analysis 38-behavior port, graph projection, store, dashboard, conformance vectors — byte-identical re-runs)
- ✅ Concurrency net (`omt_net`: probe/fire/splice/sync/invariant/synthesize/mine/gate/claim; WIP-limited pool, net-as-gate, session whitelist, generation-fenced claims)
- ✅ RAG v2 (feature_027 + 029 slash commands) + project lifecycle (feature_030) + AKB smart population loop

**Characteristics:**
- **Isolation**: All tests are isolated with mocking (no external dependencies)
- **TUI Tests**: Automated end-to-end tests using Textual Pilot
- **MVC++ Compliant**: 0 errors, 0 warnings on agent module
- **Fast**: Full suite runs in seconds

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Unknown command" error
Check your spelling with `help`. Commands are case-sensitive.

### API key prompt on startup
Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your `.env` file to avoid the interactive prompt.

### TUI not showing / keyboard input not working
- Ensure you're running in a proper terminal (not piped input)
- Check TTY capability: `sys.stdin.isatty() and sys.stdout.isatty()`
- You must opt in explicitly: `uv run agentx --tui` (console mode is now the default)

### LLM connection errors
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check your internet connection
- For local models, ensure Ollama or LlamaCpp is properly configured

### RAG ingestion fails
- Check if URL is accessible
- Verify PDF is not password-protected
- Ensure vector store directory has write permissions

---

TDD sync/lint, schema autolink, nav caps, escape/delegate folds, typed policy, task-prep slice, receipt batch, completion hardening, workflow repair 6/6, temporal replay, graph risk, transaction authority, claim generation, worktree isolation, capacity arbitration, verification lane, recovery journal, evidence deps, skip audit, KB recency, structural pins, scaffolds/LSP, budget-diet-bot, resume digest, cost benchmark 17/17 + 6/6 first-numbers, knowledge pilot, fresh-review 0 wins) + MH9 (097–101: rebase → honest-cost → boundary → work contract → frontier MERGE) — suite 2241/2241 @ close, `check` 265/0
- ✅ **meta_harness_concurrent + net_enforced_harness**: Adaptive net engine (039) + composition supervisor (040) + resource places (041) + goal-net synthesis (042) + dashboard (043) + mined net (044) + WORK-driven net (045) + session whitelist (046) + WIP-limited pool (047/048) + start menu (049) + net-as-gate (050) — live `net_rev:57`, pool places 12/15
- ✅ **improvement006 (A–H)**: Token diet — 18→7 consolidated tools (`omt_tdd`/`omt_nav`/`omt_think` with `op=`), schemas 1484→775 B, WORK.md DONE-rotation (≤8192 B), `@derive` + nav/IR budgets, HDL-2 `gate_driver` (IR-ordered gates), root-hygiene lint
- ✅ **improvement007 (A–I)**: DSL hardening — `{@var.x}` interpolation, grammar-vocab check, arg-describe diet (1609→2455 B + `tool_args` budget 2464), TS+PY consume the IR (7 hand-mirrors deleted), after-gates in the driver, IR gate messages + orphan check, derive round 2, on-demand doc diet, guide dedup; `harnessc check OK — 265 records`

### In Progress
- 🔄 **feature_001**: Petri-net-driven user objectives — session lifecycle (create → active → switch, SQLite-backed) is implemented; the Petri-net objective engine is stubbed (`GoalManager`) pending full integration
- 🔄 **rag_v2 (feature_027 + 029)**: RAG v2 + slash commands — active (`src/agentx/model/rag_v2/`, `ui/screens/rag_v2/`)
- 🔄 **project_lifecycle (feature_030)**: Project home lifecycle (`uv run scripts/omt/project.py new|link|close|sync`) — active
- ✅ **meta_harness_9 (feature_097–101)**: Rebase + isolation pins → benchmark follow-up → truthful boundary → thin work contract → frontier experiment — complete 2026-09-14 (see above)

> **Note:** Early feature directories in `.meta/` (003, 008, 009, 015) were superseded or folded into the shipped features listed above, so they are not listed separately. `WORK.md` is the live truth: `NEXT: none · Other: none · Blocked: none · Resources: 5/5 free · Pool: pending=0 active=0 done=7 (places 12/15) · net_rev:57` (2026-09-14).

### Future Features
- 🔮 Custom agent graphs with LangGraph
- 🔮 Multi-agent collaboration
- 🔮 Voice input/output
- 🔮 Web UI adapter
- 🔮 Plugin system for custom commands

## 🤝 Contributing

agentx is an educational project. Contributions are welcome!

**Development Workflow:**
1. Read `AGENTS.md` for agent behavior rules
2. Read `.meta/software_development_process/omt_agent_guide.md` for OMT++ methodology and the META HARNESS
3. Declare your phase with `omt_phase` before editing `src/`
4. For major features: follow the TDD cycle (`omt_tdd{op:testlist}` → `red` → `green` → `refactor` → `done`)
5. Run tests: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`
6. Run MVC++ check: `uv run scripts/omt/mvc_check.py`
7. Changing harness rules? Edit `.meta/META_HARNESS.omt` (never the projections), then `uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py check && uv run scripts/omt/harnessc.py build`

**Note**: This project uses opencode for development. All code changes must follow the META HARNESS process with visible artifacts.
