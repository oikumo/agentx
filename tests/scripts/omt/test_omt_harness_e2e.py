"""Comprehensive e2e smoke test for the OMT++ META HARNESS.

This test intentionally spans the whole process-enforcement surface instead of
only one unit:

- the opencode plugin source that gates OMT phases;
- the standalone status plugin;
- the Python OMT helper scripts;
- the live opencode permission config;
- the OMT guide / template contract that the gate enforces.

When it passes, it writes an ignored runtime receipt under `.meta/.omt/`. The
opencode plugin uses that receipt to force a fresh run before repeatedly editing
the OMT harness after it has changed.

Run with:
