"""Golden tests for P1-3: validate-exit coverage scoped to the feature diff
(feature_028, meta_harness_3 v1.2).

R5: the rolling per-edit snapshot baseline (last cmd_green) is NOT a feature
baseline — validate-exit must diff against a FEATURE-baseline snapshot tier
(captured at first RED, stored per-feature under SNAPSHOT_DIR/feature_baseline/)
so the coverage scan checks only methods ADDED by THIS feature. No baseline →
legacy full-file scan (protection preserved, D5).
