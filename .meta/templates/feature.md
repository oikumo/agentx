## Summary

<!-- One paragraph: what this feature is and why it exists. -->

## Scope (one sentence — what "done" looks like)

<!-- If you cannot fill this in, you are still in Analysis. -->

## Task type

<!-- bug_fix | minor_feature | major_feature | new_screen | refactor -->

## Phase artifacts (traceability)

Per `omt_agent_guide.md §12`, fill only the rows your task type requires. Link each
artifact as it is produced so WORK.md → this file → every phase doc stays navigable.

| Phase | Artifact | Path | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| Requirements | Use case | `2.requirements/.../{{SLUG}}/` | [ ] |
| Analysis | Analysis doc | `3.analysis/features/{{SLUG}}/analysis_001_*.md` | [ ] |
| Design | Design doc | `4.design/features/{{SLUG}}/design_001_*.md` | [ ] |
| Implementation | Impl notes | `5.implementation/features/{{SLUG}}/` | [ ] |
| Testing | Test report | `6.testing/features/{{SLUG}}/` | [ ] |

**Naming convention (enforced by `new_feature.py`):** phase docs are
`analysis_NNN_<topic>.md`, `design_NNN_<topic>.md` — incrementing `NNN`, lower_snake topic.
Do **not** create ad-hoc `*_PROOF.md` / `*_SUMMARY.md` files; fold proofs into the test report.
