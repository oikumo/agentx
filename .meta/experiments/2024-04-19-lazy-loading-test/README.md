# Lazy Loading Test - Token Optimization

**Date**: 2024-04-19  
**Purpose**: Validate lazy loading approach for Meta Project Harness  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED (7/7 tests)

---

## Hypothesis

Lazy loading + content deduplication will reduce token consumption by ~60-70% while preserving all critical information.

## Approach

1. Create centralized documents (DIRECTIVES.md, WORKFLOWS.md)
2. Optimize all META.md files to use references
3. Validate with automated tests
4. Measure token savings

## Results

- **Token reduction**: ~68% average
- **Line reduction**: 1,339 → 552 lines (59%)
- **Tests passed**: 7/7 (100%)
- **Information loss**: 0%

## Files

- `test_lazy_approach.py` - Automated validation script
- `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive results
- `../.meta/project_development/OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Full analysis

## Decision

✅ **INTEGRATE** - Lazy loading approach is validated and should be adopted as the standard for all Meta Project Harness documentation.

## Next Steps

None - experiment complete and findings integrated.
