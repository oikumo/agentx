## The 6 Core Directives

| # | Directive | Enforcement |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **NEVER commit/push** | Not even if user asks |
| 2 | **NEVER add dependencies** | Use existing; explicit approval required |
| 3 | **NEVER modify `.env`** | Or any secrets/credentials file |
| 4 | **ALWAYS check `git log`** | Before making ANY changes |
| 5 | **NEVER modify `tests/`** | Use `.meta/tests_sandbox/` |
| 6 | **Use `uv` & `pyproject.toml`** | For all dependency management |

## Quick Decision Guide

```\nWant to commit? → NO
Want to add package? → NO (unless approved)
Want to edit .env? → NO
About to change code? → Check git log first
Want to edit tests/? → NO (use .meta/tests_sandbox/)
Installing packages? → Use uv + pyproject.toml
```
